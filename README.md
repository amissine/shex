### Presentation

[Slide 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gq_d3q19xkDIenS_KM-PEKy7r3rBkAyOMJJWVPPb2Us/edit#slide=id.p). Hi there, I’m Дід Alik. Let me introduce to you the Stellar Help Exchange - an equitable distributed marketplace that runs on the Stellar Network. It is a place where Stellar users exchange all kinds of help for rewards. If you do not get the help you paid for, you are guaranteed to get your payment back. Here is an example.

[Slide 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gq_d3q19xkDIenS_KM-PEKy7r3rBkAyOMJJWVPPb2Us/edit#slide=id.g13c15ebba7f_0_5). Ann lives in Miami. Her family of 4 wants red snapper for dinner tonight. She picks up her smartphone, connects to Stellar network and makes a request: “Fresh red snapper for 4 persons GGS. HEXA 1000”. HEXA is the Help Exchange Asset used to reward help providers. All Stellar users can now see this request.

Now Bob the fisherman has just caught a big red snapper nearby Key Biscayne. He offers it on Stellar HEX, so that everyone can now see the offer he made: “Freshly caught red snapper 4 lb. HEXA 800”.

Enters Cyn the arbitrageur. She sees Ann’s request and Bob’s offer and is taking them both. If and when both the request and the offer are taken, Cyn gets HEXA 1000 from Ann and Bob gets HEXA 800 from Cyn. Now Cyn must deliver the snapper to Ann. And Bob must deliver it to Cyn first. If both Bob and Cyn deliver (or if Bob delivers the snapper to Ann), end of story.

For some reason Bob fails to deliver on time, so Cyn makes a claim. The HEXA 800 is automatically taken back from Bob and paid back to Cyn. And Bob’s reputation suffers. But if Bob can later prove the delivery, he keeps the reward and Cyn’s reputation suffers.

Finally, Cyn does not want to wait for a claim from Ann and Cyn’s reputation to suffer as a result of Ann’s claim. So Cyn pays HEXA 1000 back to Ann right away.

are fully supported by the Stellar network. I have a proof-of-concept demo 
implementing the example outlined here. Here is its URL:

You can either run the demo yourself, or watch the video I made while running it:
